Continuous deployment (CD) is the practice of using automation to publish and deploy software updates. As part of the typical CD process, the code is automatically built and tested before deployment.
Continuous integration (CI) is a software practice that requires frequently committing code to a shared repository. Committing code more often detects errors sooner and reduces the amount of code a developer needs to debug when finding the source of an error. Frequent code updates also make it easier to merge changes from different members of a software development team. This is great for developers, who can spend more time writing code and less time debugging errors or resolving merge conflicts.
